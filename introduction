------------------------------------Introduction to Next.js------------------------------------------------------
Slide 1: Introduction to Next.js

Definition: Next.js is a React framework for building fast, scalable web applications with features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).

SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
How it works: Every time a user visits the page, the server quickly builds the page with the latest data and sends it to the user.
Example: Imagine a news website. You want the latest articles every time you visit, so the server prepares the page each time someone asks for it.
When to use: Good for pages that need fresh data every time, like news feeds or personalized dashboards.

SSG (Static Site Generation)
How it works: The page is built just once when you first set it up. After that, it’s saved as a file, ready to be sent to everyone quickly.

When to use: Best for pages that don’t change often, like blogs or marketing pages, because it’s faster to load.

Key Advantage: Offers pre-rendering, automatic code splitting, and excellent developer experience.

--------------------------------WHY USE NEXT.Js---------------------------------------------------------
Slide 2: Why Use Next.js?

Performance: Optimized for speed with built-in SSR and SSG
SEO Friendly: Server-rendered pages load faster, improving SEO
Developer Experience: Fast refresh, intuitive API, and built-in TypeScript support
File-Based Routing: Easy routing based on the file structure
API Routes: you can define API logic directly within your Next.js app without needing a separate backend server.

--------------------------------CORE FEATURES OF EXT>JS-----------------------------------------------------------

Slide 3: Core Features of Next.js
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) - Pages rendered on the server for fast load times
Static Site Generation (SSG) - Pages pre-generated at build time, ideal for blogs, documentation
API Routes - Build backend endpoints without needing a separate server
Image Optimization - Built-in image handling for improved performance
Automatic Code Splitting - Only necessary code loads per page for faster navigation

------------------------------File Based Routing-------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 4: File-Based Routing
Overview: Pages are organized in the pages/ folder.
Dynamic Routing: Create routes by naming files with brackets, e.g., [id].js for dynamic routes.
Link Component: For internal navigation without reloading the page, similar to single-page apps.

------------------------------Rendering Methods------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 5: Rendering Methods in Next.js
Client-Side Rendering (CSR) - JavaScript runs on the client
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) - Data fetching and rendering occur on the server
Static Site Generation (SSG) - Pages pre-rendered at build time
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) - Allows updating static content without rebuilding the entire site

-------------------------------Data Fetching-------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 6: Data Fetching in Next.js
getStaticProps - For SSG, fetches data at build time
getServerSideProps - For SSR, fetches data on each request
getStaticPaths - Used with getStaticProps for dynamic paths
API Routes - Fetch data directly from server-side endpoints in Next.js

------------------------------Advantages------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 7: Advantages and Use Cases
Advantages:
Improved SEO and performance
Streamlined development with server-side capabilities
Great for static and dynamic content
Use Cases:
Blogs and documentation (SSG)
E-commerce (SSR/ISR for dynamic content)
Portfolios, company websites, and landing pages

-----------------------------Tailwind In Next.js-------------------------------------------------------
Slide 8: Next.js with Tailwind CSS
Styling Option: Easy integration with Tailwind CSS
Utility-First CSS: Provides fast and responsive styling
Advantages: Consistent design system and easier component styling

---------------------------API Routes-------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 9: Next.js API Routes
What: Built-in API routes allow adding backend functionality
Use Cases: Authentication, form handling, data processing
How: Create routes by adding files to pages/api (e.g., pages/api/hello.js)

-------------------------------Conclusion-----------------------------------------------------
Slide 10: Conclusion
Why Choose Next.js?: Great for SEO, optimized performance, developer-friendly.
Future with Next.js: Ideal for projects requiring both static and dynamic content, with growing community support.
