In Next.js, a component is a reusable, independent piece of UI that can be used to build complex user interfaces. Components help you break down the UI into smaller parts, which can be used multiple times across different pages, making your code more organized and maintainable.

Key Features of Components in Next.js:
--------------------------------------

Reusable: Components allow you to write code once and reuse it wherever needed.

Modular: Each component can focus on a single task or UI section, promoting separation of concerns.

Composable: Components can be combined to create more complex UIs, allowing for easy management of complex applications.

Props: Components can accept inputs (props) to customize their content, making them flexible for different uses.

Types of Components in Next.js:
-------------------------------

Static Components: These components don't rely on any data that changes dynamically and are pre-rendered.In Next.js, you'll often create components for things like headers, footers, navbars, buttons, and any reusable piece of your UI.

Dynamic Components: These components may depend on user interactions, data fetched from APIs, or state changes (using useState, for example).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// components/Button.js
import React from 'react';

function Button({ label }) {
  return <button>{label}</button>;
}

export default Button;
---------------------------------
// pages/index.js
import Button from '../components/Button';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Next.js App</h1>
      <Button label="Click Me" />
    </div>
  );
}
